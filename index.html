					<h2>Code of Consent</h2>
					<p>Every Togethernet instance should be accomodated by a Code of Consent, a document detailing the level of consent and
					protection the user have while using the software. Users are asked to read and approve the Code of Consent when they log
					into a new Togethernet instance. If you do not approve the provided Code of Consent and would like to provide comments,
					you may visit the Togethernet’s Github and file an issue.</p>
				<p>Enter ↓ to read the Code of Consent</a></p>

					<h1>Togethernet Code of Consent v0.1</h1>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>The Togethernet Code of Consent (CoC) is a specification that outlines the level of consent and protection that
						participants have while using the software.</p>
					<p>Consent is defined as the act of giving permission for something to occur, and we use that term in this document
						to refer to the permissions that are presented with regards to Togethernet’s users’ data.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>As you read through this Code of Consent, please consider the following invitations:</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment fade-in">We invite you to take your time.</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-in">We invite you to dig deeper.</li>

					<p>We acknowledge the trauma that accompanies surrendering information about ourselves in the digital realm without
						being given insight into how platforms work, and how they protect or expose us in the process.<sup>1</sup> In
						constructive resistance against that, we offer this document, intended to give you a clear understanding of the
						ethos and agreements behind this software and how they affect your privacy.</p>

					<p>Structurally informed by the F.R.I.E.S. model created by Planned Parenthood, we believe that a consentful
						software should be designed and built through the lens of being <em>Freely given, Reversible, Informed,
							Enthusiastic and Specific</em>. You can learn more about how each of these terms contribute to a more
						consentful software through the <a

					<h2>The Foundations</h2>
					<p>Togethernet is a consentful digital archiving software in the form of a desktop web app that allows both
						peer-to-peer (P2P), traceless messaging as well as archived communications.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Who should use this?</h3>
					<p>This software is for you if you are an artist, designer, community organizer, technologist, researcher, educator,
						or student who is interested in –</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Exiting surveillance capitalism</li>
						<li>Participating in consentful communications on the web</li>
						<li>Building community-owned digital archives</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Togethernet is a software in pursuit of intentional and ongoing <em>consentful</em> engagement that prioritizes
						the digital autonomy and privacy of our users. We do not sell any of our users’ data nor does the software run
						on advertising. Those who are seeking a digital environment designed with safety in mind are encouraged to use
						Togethernet.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Togethernet aspires towards accessibility and inclusivity. We acknowledge that the alpha version of the software
						falls short of that aspiration, as it is not currently fully accessible to the Blind and low-vision community.
						It is our intention to dedicate future resources towards ensuring that upcoming versions of Togethernet are
						designed with the needs of this community at the forefront.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Who shouldn’t use this?</h3>
					<p>Togethernet uses WebRTC to conduct peer-to-peer communications, which is encrypted by default but exposes the
						participant's public IP address in the process of communicating to servers. This software will most likely not
						have adequate privacy protections for individuals working with highly sensitive issues and who are concerned
						with targeted surveillance.</p>
					<p>Instead we recommend you looking into <a href='https://www.signal.org/' target='_blank'>Signal</a>, an end-to-end
						encrypted messenger that has been tested by cybersecurity experts all over the world and is trusted by
						journalists and activists who are working with sensitive content.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Additionally, this software is not intended for people who are not invested in consentful engagement with others.
						While the establishment of a consentful digital environment begins within its design infrastructure, the
						maintenance of this environment relies on a dedicated community. Individuals whose intentions are to cause harm
						should not use Togethernet.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>On Developer Responsibilities</h3>
					<p>Developers who choose to adapt Togethernet’s open-source code in their projects, licenced under <a
							href='https://github.com/together-support/togethernet/blob/main/LICENSE.md' target='_blank'>ACSL
							1.4</a>,<sup>2</sup> are expected to adhere to the principles of consent outlined and prioritized by this
						software, and not alter the code in a way that violates these principles of consent.</p>
					<p>It is imperative that open-source usage of this code aligns with its intended ethos of consent – developers who
						violate the privacy agreements established in this Code of Consent will be required to disaffiliate from the
						“Togethernet” name, and remove this Code of Consent document from the code entirely.</p>
					<p>We strongly encourage developers to review the <a
							href='https://www.andalsotoo.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Building-Consentful-Tech-Zine-SPREADS.pdf'
							target='_blank'>Consentful Tech Zine</a> prior to altering the code in order to ensure that the software
						remains true to its foundational principles.</p>
					<p><sup>2</sup> We also ask that a robust politics of citation be adhered to in the adaptation and use of this code
						and its embedded Code of Consent.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>System Requirements</h4>
					<p>Togethernet is a desktop web app that launches inside the browser. Currently the application runs as intended on
						Firefox (version 85.0.2) and Chrome (version 88.0.4324.150).</p>
					<h4>Capacity</h4>
					<p>Togethernet intends to facilitate consentful communications, and as we know consent is easier to negotiate within
						a micro-community. Therefore by default the application will accommodate a maximum of 12 simultaneous
						participants.<sup>3</sup></p>
					<h4>Demo</h4>
					<p>We invite you to <a href='https://togethernet.herokuapp.com/' target='_blank'>visit this link</a> to try out a
						demo version of the software. In order to test out the collaborative features, we encourage you to invite a
						friend to join.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Software Architecture</h2>
					<p>Togethernet is designed to invite you to say “YES!” along the way.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Peer to Peer Consent: Ephemeral Channel</h3>
					<p>While using Togethernet, all the text-based communications with your community take place by default under the
						Ephemeral Channels. Operating under the logic of peer-to-peer consent, the communication records created during
						the live session in Ephemeral Mode will be permanently deleted once the last participant closes their browser
						tab. To prevent messages from being deleted, participants need to go through the Consent to Archive process in
						order to publish the content to the Archival Channel, allowing the users to make <em>informed decisions</em>
						regarding their own privacy level while using Togethernet.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>In WebRTC, real time communications are achieved without needing to install any additional applications or
						plug-ins. The information that is transmitted between your browsers is anonymously and freely given by you as a
						user. There are no logins on Togethernet because on this peer-to-peer level, your identity is not recorded on a
						centralized system. Furthermore, WebRTC encrypts all data that is sent through it in order to protect users’
						communications.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>If the description above feels confusing, we invite you to take a moment to imagine:</p>
					<p>You and a friend are meeting in the street. Your intentions are to share private information with one another,
						but prior to that happening, you both require exchanging a secret handshake. The information you share is
						functionally protected by the mediating act of completing the handshake, whose steps are known only by the two
						of you. This is akin to the level of privacy enabled by WebRTC’s encryption in peer-to-peer mode.</p>
					<p>Once data has been sent from your computer to your peers’, you have the agency to decide to remove this data by
						deleting the messages. In the Ephemeral Channel, messages disappear once the last person in a given chat session
						departs. If you leave a session but return before the last person has departed, your messages will still be
						visible and accessible to those in the chat.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>The Role of the Server</h4>
					<p>While WebRTC is distinguishable in that it enables encrypted peer-to-peer connections via browsers, servers are
						still required in order to facilitate these connections. Think of the server as an impartial mediator.</p>
					<p>For a connection to be established between you and your peer computer, information must first be transmitted
						about each of your respective locations. The information that is given pertains to your local IP address (+
						more), which happens over Javascript in order to get to what is called the signaling server<sup>4</sup>. Once
						your computer has established a connection to your peer via the server, the data that has been sent about your
						location is not reversible.</p>
					<p>Communication between you and your peer happens via offers and answers that are mediated by this server. These
						offers, sent by the initiating computer to a recipient, occur once you have consented to begin an exchange on
						the software at the beginning of every instance in the Ephemeral Channel.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Peer to Server: Archival Channel</h3>
					<p>The Archival Channel operates under the logic of peer-to-server consent, where communications are published to a
						centralized database.</p>
					<p>Once messages are published to the Archival Channel, users can enter the room and become an editor. The first
						person to enter the room is automatically the editor. Subsequent users who enter the chat can become the editor
						by selecting the function in the bottom-left corner.<sup>5</sup></p>
					<p>The editor is armed with the ability to delete a message without necessarily having collective consent; as such,
						this role is one that requires an abundance of care and trust by peer users. It is encouraged that users
						communicate with their peers prior to removing messages from the archive. When messages are deleted, a trace is
						left in the archive that labels the removed message as having been deleted.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>The Archival Channel’s default database runs on <a href='https://www.postgresql.org/'
							target='_blank'>PostGres</a>, an open source database that users can run on their own, or a third-party
						server. Messages in the Archival Channel can be downloaded into an HTML page, which gives users the ability to
						host the archive of their conversation on their own website if desired.</p>
					<p>It is important to note that data stored on third-party servers might not necessarily adhere to the same consent
						principles that are outlined in this document. A list of third-party servers and their consent adherence can be
						found <a
							href='https://en.gendersec.train.tacticaltech.org/downloads/en/autonomous_and_ethical_hosting_providers.pdf'
							target='_blank'>here</a>.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Recap: Adherence to F.R.I.E.S. Model</h2>
					<p>To understand and place emphasis on how this software adheres to the Planned Parenthood F.R.I.E.S. consent
						framework, below are Togethernet’s answers to questions posed to developers in the <a
							href='https://www.andalsotoo.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Building-Consentful-Tech-Zine-SPREADS.pdf'
							target='_blank'>Consentful Tech Zine</a>.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h5>Are people <b>Freely</b> giving us their consent to access and store parts of their digital bodies?</h5>
					<p>Yes - this document is intended to arm prospective Togethernet users with an understanding of how their digital
						bodies are accessed, stored, and protected while using the software. Prospective users are invited to reach out
						with any questions or concerns in case they are not comfortable with the terms outlined here.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h5>Does our system allow for <b>Reversible</b> consent? How easy is it for people to withdraw both their consent
						and their data?</h5>
					<p>Yes - in order for messages to be archived, collective consent from all parties in the conversation is required.
						This consent can be revoked at any time by any individual in the conversation. Revoking consent removes users’
						data from the archive, but does not preclude users from continuing to use the software.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h5>How are we making sure that the consent is <b>Enthusiastic</b>? Is there an option not to use this technology,
						which means that people use it because they prefer to use it?</h5>
					<p>In order to use Togethernet, it is required to read through and agree to the Code of Consent, which is aimed at
						clearly outlining the agreements behind the software. We offer this software, and the embedded Code of Consent
						as an alternative to softwares that are rooted in surveillance capitalism. For users whose privacy needs are not
						met by Togethernet, we invite them to explore alternatives such as <a href='https://www.signal.org/'
							target='_blank'>Signal</a>.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h5>How are we fully and clearly <b>Informing</b> people about what they’re consenting to? Is important information
						about the risks a user might be exposed to buried in the fine print of the terms & conditions?</h5>
					<p>Through making use of repetition and robust citation, the information in this document is intended to be clear
						and consistent. Our intention is to be transparent in the potential risks involved with use.</p>
					<p>This Code of Consent is embedded as part of Togethernet’s Open Source software. As such, it is possible that this
						software will be re-used and altered in a way such that the code of consent is broken. In such an instance, the
						developers must take out the code of consent document from the software and disaffiliate from the Togethernet
						name.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h5>Can people consent to <b>Specific</b> things in this system and not others? Can people select which aspects of
						their digital bodies they want to have exposed and have stored?</h5>
					<p>Yes - this is accomplished via the consent to archive function, which requests the consent of all participants
						prior to moving messages into the centralized database or third-party server. Consent to archive must be
						unanimous - if one participant in the group revokes their consent, the message is removed from the Archival
						Channel for all parties.</p>

					<h1>Togethernet Orientation</h1>
					<p>You have landed in Togethernet, welcome!</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>This is a digital archiving software for a micro-community to collaborate intentionally and consentfully.</p>
					<p>We invite you to participate in a software orientation we have prepared for you, where we will walk-through the
						basic features to get you started and help you feel prepared to make the most of this space.</p>
					<p>It will take about 5~15 minutes to complete. Are you ready to begin?</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Network</h2>
					<p>Anonymity and Disconnection</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Network: Anonymity</h3>
					<p>Togethernet is a peer-to-peer application with no login system that identifies individual users.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>The benefit to this is that your personal information doesn’t get stored on someone’s server - which provides
						protection to your digital body.</p>
					<p>However, the disadvantage is that if you get disconnected from a group session due to inactivity or internet
						instability, when you return to the room you will be recognized by the network as a brand-new participant, and
						you will need to rename yourself to be recognized by your community.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>If being able to identify everyone who is in the space at all times is something that makes you feel more
						comfortable, we recommend that you use an open-source video conferencing software such as Jitsi to communicate
						and check-in with your group. While doing so, you can simultaneously use Togethernet to take notes and jolt down
						ideas. </p>
					<p>You could think of Togethernet as a replacement for text-based collaborations that take place on Google docs.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Network: Disconnection</h2>
					<p>The software is still in the alpha<sup>1</sup> version, so with that in mind we value your patience while using
						Togethernet.</p>
					<p><sup>1</sup> Alpha is a version of software that is ready to be tested by different people under different
						network conditions at a larger scale. This is in contrast to beta testing,</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Be ready to reload the page when something seems to be not responding or working in ways that don’t seem right.
						Depending on the stability of you and your collaborators’ network you may need to do this frequently. We will
						continue to work on peer to peer network stability in the upcoming software updates and look forward to
						improving the reliability that we are able to offer this community.</p>

					<h2>Navigation</h2>
					<p>Editing the Avatar, Moving Around, and Messaging</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Navigation: Edit Avatar Name & Color</h3>
					<p>When you enter Togethernet, you will be brought to the default Ephemeral Channel #sitting-in-the-park. You will
						appear in the Navigation Space as an Anonymous avatar with a randomly assigned color.</p>
					<p>We strongly recommend that you give your avatar a name that is recognizable by your community before sending any
						messages. This functions to ensure that the space remains familiar and that anonymity is a data protection
						function rather than a feature that obscures communal accountability.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Navigation: Moving Around</h2>
					<p>To move your avatar, you will first need to click on the Navigation Space to give focus to the area, then use
						your ←, ↑, →, ↓ ARROW KEYS to visit a different location on the screen.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Navigation: Send Message</h2>
					<p>The location of your avatar determines the location of where you leave a message on the screen. In order to send
						a message, click on the Message Input field at the bottom of the interface, write your message, and hit ENTER.
					</p>
					<blockquote> TIP: To switch focus between Navigation Space and Message Input, you can also use the shortcut key
						combo SHIFT + SPACE BAR.</blockquote>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Navigation: Read Message</h2>
					<p>To read a message, your avatar needs to move up into a neighboring position on any one of the four sides of a
						Message Record.</p>
					<blockquote> TIP: Another way to read the message is by hovering your mouse cursor over a text record. This enables
						you to quickly browse through different messages on the screen without having to move around. However you won’t
						be able to perform further interactions with the text record such as Replying to a Thread or Consent to Archive
						without moving your avatar next to the message record.</blockquote>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Navigation: Replying to a Thread</h2>
					<p>In order to reply to a message, you can move your avatar so that it is neighboring an existing Message Record,
						and add your message in that position. You can continue to add to the thread by extending the message records on
						the screen.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Meeting Modes</h2>
					<p>Togethernet’s foundational goal is to benefit individuals and organizations that are interested in exiting
						surveillance capitalism and practicing consentful, transparent communications within their communities. Inspired
						by <a href='https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/F/bo3682810.html' target='_blank'>Freedom is an
							Endless Meeting</a> by Francesca Polletta, the software offers three different meeting modes – Facilitated
						Mode, Feedback Mode, and Egalitarian Mode, each bundled with different features.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Facilitated Mode</h3>
					<p>The room creator can appoint 1~3 facilitator(s) in this mode. The facilitators may use the Amplify feature to
						outline agendas, ask questions and guide conversations. Participants in the room also have access to the
						majority rule feature and can turn any messages into a voting poll.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>1~3 facilitator(s)</li>
						<li>Amplify messages (only available to facilitators)</li>
						<li>Majority rule</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Feedback Mode</h3>
					<p>The room creator can appoint 0~3 facilitator(s) in this mode. If a facilitator is appointed, they can use the
						amplify feature to outline agendas, ask questions and guide conversations. Participants in the room also have
						access to the consentful gesture feature, which enables participants to provide secondary feedback, such as
						“agree”, “hesitant”, “disagree”, “block” on a message.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>0~3 facilitator(s)</li>
						<li>Amplify messages (only available to facilitators)</li>
						<li>Consentful gestures: agree, hesitatnt, disagree, block</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Egalitarian Mode</h3>
					<p>The organization does not use a facilitator and members discuss issues without implementing a meta-structure.
						Most chatrooms function this way and its ability to maintain consent may be limited.<sup>2</sup></p>
					<p>Instead we recommend you looking into <a href='https://www.signal.org/' target='_blank'>Signal</a>, an end-to-end
						encrypted messenger that has been tested by cybersecurity experts all over the world and is trusted by
						journalists and activists who are working with sensitive content.</p>
					<p><sup>2</sup> See the <a href='https://www.jofreeman.com/joreen/tyranny.htm' target='_blank'>Tyranny of
							Structurelessness</a> by Jo Freeman aka Joreen.</p>
