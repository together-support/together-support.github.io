					<h1>What is Togethernet?</h1>
					<p>Togethernet is a collaborative archiving software in the form of a desktop web app that allows both
						peer-to-peer(P2P), traceless messaging as well as archived communications.</p>
					
					<p>Designed around the ethos of data transparency and consent, the goal of the software is to transform digital rights
						practices such as the <a href="https://gdpr.eu/right-to-be-forgotten/">right to be forgotten</a> into an embodied
						practice through the reimagination of software architecture and user experience.</p>

						<p>This tool and initiative stands on the shoulder of <a href="test">Consentful Tech Zine</a> by Una Lee and Dann Toliver
						and <a href="https://designjustice.org/read-the-principles">Design Justice Network Principles</a> ⁠— by considering transparency and consent every step of the way, the source
						code serves as both a technical and a moral document that seeks to uncover systems of power and uncertainties
						embedded in network technologies.</p>
					</section>
					<section id="section-3">

						<h1>How does it work?</h1>
						<p>Togethernet contains two types of communication channels: the <i>Ephemeral Channel</i> and the <i>Archival Channel</i>.</p>
						<h2>Ephemeral Channel</h2>
						<img class="screenshot" src="assets/screenshots/ephemeralChannel.png" alt="screenshot of the ephemeral channel" />
						<p>The <i>Ephemeral Channel</i> uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebRTC" >WebRTC
								peer-to-peer protocol</a>, which means conversations do not go through a centralized server and are
							permenantly erased once the browser closes.</p>
						<p class="standout">PRIVACY SCENARIO: using the <i>Ephemeral Channel</i> is comparable to talking to friends on a picnic blanket at the
							park — your conversations won’t be heard unless someone is intentionally trying to listen in.</p>
						<h2>Archival Channel</h2>
						<img class="screenshot" src="assets/screenshots/archivalChannel.png" alt="screenshot of the archival channel" />
						<p>The <i>Archival Channel</i> publishes meeting notes to a centeralized database that your organization may
							self-host or host on a third party’s server.</p>
						<p class="standout">PRIVACY SCENARIO: using the <i>Archival Channel</i> is comparable to posting a note on a bulletin board — your words are now floating out
							there on the World Wide Web as a form of public record, and others may quote or use it in ways that are outside
							of your control. Organizations often need to create content that needs to be seen by the public and this is
							useful for that.</p>
					</section>
					<section id="section-4">
						<hr>
						<h1>Is Togethernet for me?</h1>
						<p>Togethernet is created with micro-communities in mind. In particular, those who work under the broad umbrella of
							art, design, culture and technology. This software is for you if you are an artist, designer, community
							organizer, technologist, researcher, educator, or student interested in –</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Exiting surveillance capitalism</li>
							<li>Participating in consentful communications on the web</li>
							<li>Building community-owned digital archives</li>
						</ul>
						<h2>Use Cases</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>You may be a book club, and instead of defaulting to facebook groups, you might use Togethernet to create a
								list of books to read.</li>
							<li>You may be a group of art students working on a community agreement, and instead of defaulting to google doc
								you might use Togethernet to document your collective needs.</li>
							<li>You may be a group of community organizers, and instead of defaulting to instagram you might use Togethernet
								to save a list of Teach-In content to generate an HTML page to be uploaded to your website.</li>
						</ul>
						<h2>Known Vulnerabilities</h2>
						<p>That said, this software is still in an experimental stage and there are known vulnerabilities. If you're someone who is looking to work with highly sensitive content or if you're concerned with targeted surveillance, we recommend you looking into <a href="https://www.signal.org/">Signal</a>.</p>
						<p>If you're feeling ready to dig deeper, we inivite you to the Getting Started page.</p>
