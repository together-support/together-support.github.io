					the Togethernet organizers.</p>
					<h3>Be mindful of your language.</h3>

					<h3>Use your best judgement.</h3>
					<p>If it will possibly make others uncomfortable, do not say it or post to the Togethernet platform.</p>

					<h3>Togethernet Code of Conduct</h3>
					<p>This Code of Conduct was compiled by Dorothy Santos and remixed by Xin Xin, based on resources provided by Geek
					Feminism, and borrows heavily from open source policies authored by p5.js and XOXO Festival.</p>
					<p>This policy is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license and on the Togethernet website.
					We encourage other organizations to adopt (and enforce) similar Codes of Conduct by using and remixing this one.</p>
					<p>Ideas for Togethernet did not come out of the ether. We are deeply grateful that <a href="https://www.andalsotoo.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Building-Consentful-Tech-Zine-SPREADS.pdf">Consentful Tech Zine</a>, published by Una Lee and Dann Toliver under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode">CC-BY</a> in 2017 had the foresight of using F.R.I.E.S.
						(Freely given, Informed, Specific, Reversible, Enthusiastic), a model of consent by Planned Parenthood as a metric to
						assess data consent in the digital sphere.</p>
						
						<p>Thank you ‚Äì Kemi Sijuwade-Ukadike, J. Soto, Sally Szwed, Roddy Schrock, Maddie Pinney, Eric Tang, Dorothy R. Santos, Kate
					Hollenbach, Lee Tusman, and An Xiao Mina for listening, user-testing, contributing, and engaging with this project.</p>
