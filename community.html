					<p>Ideas for TogetherNet did not come out of the ether. We are deeply grateful that <a href="https://www.andalsotoo.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Building-Consentful-Tech-Zine-SPREADS.pdf">Consentful Tech Zine</a>, published by Una Lee and Dann Toliver under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode">CC-BY</a> in 2017 had the foresight of using F.R.I.E.S.
						(Freely given, Informed, Specific, Reversible, Enthusiastic), a model of consent by Planned Parenthood as a metric to
						assess data consent in the digital sphere.</p>
					
					<p>The TogetherNet website uses Livia Foldes' interview with Walei Sabry, and the <a href="https://alt-text-as-poetry.net/">Alt-Text as Poetry website</a> as conceptual
					and design references.</p>
						
					<p>Our deep gratitudes go towards – Kemi Sijuwade-Ukadike, J. Soto, Sally Szwed, Roddy Schrock, Maddie Pinney, Eric Tang,
					Dorothy R. Santos, Walei Sabry, Shannon Finnegan, Kate Hollenbach, and An Xiao Mina. Thank you for
					listening, user-testing, contributing, and engaging with this project.</p>
